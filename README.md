# Hal

### Hal is an AI from the 1980s. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Hal answers **'Affirmative, Dave.'** if you ask him a question.

He answers **'You seem very agitated.'** if you yell at him.

He says **'My mind is going...'** if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers **'That is unimportant to the mission, Dave.'** to anything else.

You have a test suite with tests that you need to make pass. They are all disabled except the first one right now. To enable a test, remove the x from in from of the it() function. Enable one test at a time and make it pass before enabling the next. This is how Test Driven Development (TDD) works.

## Instructions
